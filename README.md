# Open-Source-Documentation

### Look for and then read the CONTRIBUTING file

Open source projects have a CONTRIBUTING section or look out the issues taged with "Documentation"

#### Ideas

Participate in an Issues thread or start your own to have your voice heard.

#### Write

Fork the Repository you want to contribute to  then Contribute your expertise in an area by helping The organisation expand the included content,Fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.Fix issues or contribute new features.Help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting

#### Outline sections 
Help The Organisation to ensure that this repository is comprehensive. if there is a topic that is overlooked, please add it, Even if it is just a stub in the form of a header and single sentence. Initially, most things fall into this category.

### Create a Pull Request
Create a Pull Request after commiting your work, If the Member of the organoisation accept it theyâ€™ll merge in the changes into the repository. If not they may ask you to change the wording  after having a discussion in the comments on the pull request. Or they may not merge the Pull request(which is completely fine as this experiance will help you next time)

So one can contribute to projects without the need to even code.
